# FreeEzPOS : Free opensource simple POS

FreeEzPOS is a free simple POS meant for small business and restaurants. It targets providing an easy experience for shop owners who don't want the hassle of installing a full-fledged complex system, and are low on cash ....

# Why another POS ??
The market is full of POS solutions, but I couldn't find an Open source POS that meet the mark for small businesses when it comes to :
- **Modernity**
  The most famous POS opensource desktop solutions are almost a decade old, they need older runtimes, an usually has horrible UI's. While the UI can be tolerated, eventually using the runtimes on modern computers can lead to issues.
- **Working offline**
  The mainstream free POS systems are cloud services. While this being online 24/7 is not an issue in some countries, in many other places, it is.
  So, a POS system should be standalone if possible.
- **Easy installation**
  Most opensource POS requires a dedicated database server, others are web complete application that needs the installation of the entire tech-stack. Regardless, It was hard to find a free or opensource POS that just runs out of the box with a double click.
- **Can work on old and low spec computers.**
  This is important specially in thrid world countries, being able to use a cheap old computer with a lightweight linux can be a big plus. For many this can be biggest hurdle in adopting a POS solution.
  Lots of POS systems uses an entire tech-stack that makes this hard to accomplish, ideally a simple POS should run even on SBC(Single board computers) like Rasperry-PI.
- **Being cross-platform**
  This is related to the last issue.
  Lot's of free and opensource POS uses .net framework, which mostly means the user can only use a windows machine. This limits their options for using lower spec and cheaper hardware.



FreeEzPOS hopes to provide a free solution to solve these concerns:
- FreeEzPOS is a standalone desktop application
- It is lightweight, and can run on your decade old computer, and can run on windows, linux and MacOs.
- It requires no technical experience to install, just double click its icon, it will do the rest.
- FreeEzPOS is minimal by design, users can add the features they need via plugins.
- FreeEzPOS uses modern technologies, so, it has better UI's and better support in the foresible future.
